    <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
    <p>This section specifies how the user can set up a [=wallet address=].</p>

    <h3>Terms</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Web Monetization page</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Refers to the browser's UI for managing Web Monetization settings, accessible via a browser specific URI.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Interactive grant</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Open Payments requires outgoing payment [=grant=] requests to be interactive. When a grant request is interactive, it means explicit interaction by an individual (typically the clientâ€™s end user) is a required step in the delegation process.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            After the grant request is made, the client must poll for a Grant Continuation request so the [=AS=] knows to issue an access token.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            The redirect URI is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the outgoing payment grant ([=interactive grant=]) when conneting their [=wallet=] to the browser.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">In Chromium based browserm the page can be located at `chrome://webmonetization`.</p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <h4>Ed25519 keypair</h4>
    <p>The Ed25519 private key is going to be used to generate HTTP signatures (Open Payments).</p>
    <p>The Ed25519 public key needs to be stored as a base64-encoded <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>. The users will have to upload to public their public key in their wallet application, in order for the [=AS=] to verify the HTTP signature. The base64-encoded public key will be displayed in the setup screen.</p> 
    <div class="note">
        <p>The key pair should be generated only <b>ONCE</b>. If the user comes back to the [=Web Monetization page=], the browser should not generate it again. Alternatively, the key pair can be generated once the browser is installed/opened the first time, therefore no additional checks are needed when the user navigates to [=Web Monetization page=].</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Key ID</h4>
    <p>The key ID (`kid`) is a randomly generated string. In the Web Monetization Extension an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-uuid-version-4">UUID version 4</a> is used for the `kid`.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="JWK Example">
        <pre class="json">
            {
                "kid": "random-generated-string",
                "x": "base64-url-encoded-public-key",
                "alg": "EdDSA",
                "kty": "OKP",
                "crv": "Ed25519"
            }
        </pre>

    <h3>Connecting a wallet</h3>
    <p>The user can initiate the wallet setup from the [=web monetization page=], which provides a UI for specifying the [=wallet address=], and the budget.</p>
    <p class="note">An example of such a UI could be an "Add a Wallet" button that opens a dialog for entering this information, with an "Add" button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.</p>
    <p>To process the wallet setup, given a string <var>walletAddress</var>, number <var>budget</var> and boolean <var>renewMonthly</var>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Let <var>walletAddress</var> (string) be the [=wallet address=] provided by the user, <var>budget</var> (number) be the budget that the user wants to use for Web Monetization and <var>renewMonthly</var> (boolean) the option to renew the budget every month.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>walletAddressDetails</var> be the result of the [=send a wallet address request=] algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>interval</var> be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Repeating_intervals">ISO 8601 repeating interval</a> if <var>renewMonthly</var> is `true`.
            <p class="note">
                The starting date for the repeating interval needs to be the users current date (ISO String).
            </p>
            <aside class="example" title="ISO 8601 Repeating interval - monthly renewal">

                  R/2025-01-28T02:12:16.254Z/P1M
               </pre>
            </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>grant</var> be the result of the [=send an outgoing payment and quote grant request=] algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>continueUri</var> be <var>grant</var>'s `continue.uri` property at which the client instance can make <a data-cite="opas/operations/post-continue#">continuation requests</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the <var>grant</var>'s `redirectUri` property ([=Redirect URI=]) in a new tab to redirect the user to its wallet [=IdP=], where the user can accept or decline the grant. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>wait</var> be <var>grant</var>'s `continue.wait` property. It represents the polling interval in seconds.</li>
            <p class="note">
                We cannot use the finish redirect method because internal browser URLs can not be opened from an external source. In the Open Payments scenario, the [=AS=] will have to redirect the user to the internal browser page for Web Monetization to continue the flow.
                Since we cannot use Open Payments' redirect finish method, we will have to check every <var>wait</var> seconds (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)">polling</a>) to retrieve information about the grant (user accepted or rejected the grant).
            </p>
        <li>
            Start polling the <var>continueUri</var> to get the information about the grant state every <var>wait</var> seconds.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Let `intervalId` be the result of calling {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval()}} with send a continuation request as callback and the interval <var>wait</var>: 
                    <p class="warning">
                        The `wait` property of <var>grant</var> is defined in seconds. When calling {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval()}}, <var>wait</var> needs to be converted to milliseconds.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 200, a finalized grant is returned - the user accepted the grant and the information (TBD: define what informations can be saved) can be saved in the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 401, the user rejected the grant and the process stops.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
