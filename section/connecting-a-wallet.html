    <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
    <p>This section specifies how the user can set their [=wallet address=] for Web Monetization in the user agent.</p>

            Refers to the browser's UI for managing Web Monetization settings, accessible via a browser specific URI.
            <span class="note">In Chromium based browser the page can be located at `chrome://webmonetization`.</span>
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn data-lt="setup page">Web Monetization setup page</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Refers to the browser's UI for setting up Web Monetization on the [=Web Monetization page=]. The UI lets user specify the [=wallet address=], and the budget.
            <span class="note">An example of such a UI could be an "Add a Wallet" button that opens a dialog for entering this information, with an "Add" button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.</span>
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Interactive grant</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Open Payments requires outgoing payment [=grant=] requests to be interactive. When a grant request is interactive, it means explicit interaction by an individual (typically the clientâ€™s end user) is a required step in the delegation process.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            After the grant request is made, the client must poll for a Grant Continuation request so the [=AS=] knows to issue an access token.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            The redirect URI is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the outgoing payment grant ([=interactive grant=]) when conneting their [=wallet=] to the browser.

    <h3>Ed25519 keypair</h3>
    <p>The Ed25519 <dfn>private key</dfn> [[RFC8032]] is used to generate HTTP signatures (Open Payments).</p>

    <p>The Ed25519 <dfn>public key</dfn> needs to be stored as a base64-encoded [[[RFC7517]]] with the <a data-cite="RFC8037#section-2">`OKP` key type</a>. The users will have to upload to public their public key to their wallet application, in order for the [=AS=] to verify the HTTP signature.</p>

    <p class="note">The `x` part of the JWK MUST be <a data-cite="RFC4648#section-5">base64url encoded</a>, with the padding characters omitted.</p>

    <p>The JWK's <a data-cite="RFC7517#section-4.5">`kid`</a> (<dfn>Key ID</dfn>) is a randomly generated string. <span class="note">In the [[[Extension]]], a <a data-cite="RFC9562#name-uuid-version-4">UUID version 4</a> is used.</span></p>

    <p class="note">The base64-encoded [=public key=] will be displayed in the [=setup page=].</p>
    <p class="note">The key pair should be generated only <b>ONCE</b>. If the user comes back to the [=Web Monetization page=], the browser should not generate it again. Alternatively, the key pair can be generated once the browser is installed/opened the first time, therefore no additional checks are needed when the user navigates to [=Web Monetization page=]. If the key-pair is generated again, the user will need to add the [=public key=] to their wallet again and complete the wallet connect process all over again.</p>
