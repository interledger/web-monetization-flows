    <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
    This section specifies how the user can set up a [=wallet address=].

    <h3>Terms</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Web Monetization page</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Refers to the browser's UI for managing Web Monetization settings, accessible via a browser specific URI.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Interactive grant</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Open Payments requires outgoing payment [=grant=] requests to be interactive. When a grant request is interactive, it means explicit interaction by an individual (typically the clientâ€™s end user) is a required step in the delegation process.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            After the grant request is made, the client must poll for a Grant Continuation request so the [=AS=] knows to issue an access token.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn></dt>
        <dd>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-uuid-version-4:wallet0
            The redirect URI is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the outgoing payment grant ([=interactive grant=]) when conneting their [=wallet=] to the browser.
        </dd> 
    </dl>

    <p class="note">In Chromium based browserm the page can be located at `chrome://webmonetization`.</p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <h4>Ed25519 keypair</h4>
    <p>The Ed25519 private key is going to be used to generate HTTP signatures (Open Payments).</p>
    <p>The Ed25519 public key needs to be stored as a base64-encoded JWK. The users will have to upload to public their public key in their wallet application, in order for the [=AS=] to verify the HTTP signature. The base64-encoded public key will be displayed in the setup screen.</p> 

    <div class="note">
        <p>The key pair should be generated only <b>ONCE</b>. If the user comes back to the [=Web Monetization page=], the browser should not generate it again. Alternatively, the key pair can be generated once the browser is installed/opened the first time, therefore no additional checks are needed when the user navigates to [=Web Monetization page=].</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Key ID</h4>

    <p>The key ID (`kid`) is a randomly generated string. In the Web Monetization Extension an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-uuid-version-4">UUID version 4</a> is used for the `kid`.</p>

        <pre class="json">
            {
                "kid": "random-generated-string",
                "x": "base64-url-encoded-public-key",
                "alg": "EdDSA",
                "kty": "OKP",
                "crv": "Ed25519"
            }
        </pre>

    <h3>Connecting a wallet</h3>
    <p>The user can initiate the wallet setup from the [=web monetization page=], which provides a UI for specifying the [=wallet address=], and the budget.</p>
    <p class="note">An example of such a UI could be an "Add a Wallet" button that opens a dialog for entering this information, with an "Add" button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.</p>

    <p>To process the wallet setup, given a string <var>walletAddress</var>, number <var>budget</var> and boolean <var>renewMonthly</var>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Let <var>walletAddress</var> (string) be the [=wallet address=] provided by the user, <var>budget</var> (number) be the budget that the user wants to use for Web Monetization and <var>renewMonthly</var> (boolean) the option to renew the budget every month.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>walletAddressDetails</var> be the result of the [=send a wallet address request=] algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>interval</var> be an ISO 8601 repeating interval if <var>renewMonthly</var> is `true`.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>headers</var> be an ISO 8601 repeating interval if <var>renewMonthly</var> is `true`.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>grant</var> be the result of the [=send an outgoing payment and quote grant request=] algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the <var>grant</var>'s `redirectUri` property in a new tab to redirect the user to its wallet [=IdP=], where the user can accept or decline the grant. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>continueUri</var> be <var>grant</var>'s `continueUri` property at which the client instance can make continuation requests..
        </li>
        <li>
        Let <var>wait</var> be <var>grant</var>'s `continue.wait` property. It represents the polling interval in seconds.</li>
        <li>
            Start polling the <var>continuationUri</var> to get the information about the grant state every <var>wait</var> seconds.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 200, a finalized grant is returned - the user accepted the grant and the information (TBD: define what informations can be saved) can be saved in the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 401, the user rejected the grant and the process stops.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
