    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The specification defines the browser implementation for setting up a
        wallet and managing the payment session flow. To start using web
        monetization in a browser, the user must add a wallet to enable web
        monetization payments while browsing the web. When a user visits a [=web monetized website=],
        the payment session begins, facilitated through a series of
        [[[openpayments]]] (<abbr title="Open Payments">OP</abbr>) calls.
        This document details the procedures and protocols involved.

    <p class="note">
        [Ongoing discussions] The specification assumes that the parties are using the same [=asset code=] and [=asset scale=]. Cross currency scenarios will be defined later on.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        [Ongoing discussions] The specification assumes that a payment sessions will start without user interaction.
