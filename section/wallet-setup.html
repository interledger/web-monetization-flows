  <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
  <p>This section specifies how the user can set their [=wallet address=] for Web Monetization in the user agent.</p>

  <h3>Terms</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>Web Monetization page</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Refers to the browser's UI for managing Web Monetization settings, accessible via a browser specific URI.
      <span class="note">In Chromium based browser the page can be located at `chrome://webmonetization`.</span>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="setup page">Web Monetization setup page</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Refers to the browser's UI for setting up Web Monetization on the [=Web Monetization page=]. The UI lets user specify the [=wallet address=], and the budget.
      <span class="note">An example of such a UI could be an "Add a Wallet" button that opens a dialog for entering this information, with an "Add" button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.</span>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Interactive grant</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Open Payments requires outgoing payment [=grant=] requests to be interactive. When a grant request is interactive, it means explicit interaction by an individual (typically the clientâ€™s end user) is a required step in the delegation process.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      After the grant request is made, the client must poll for a Grant Continuation request so the [=AS=] knows to issue an access token.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The redirect URI is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the outgoing payment grant ([=interactive grant=]) when conneting their [=wallet=] to the browser.

  <h3>Connecting a wallet</h3>

  <p>The user can initiate the wallet setup from the [=setup page=].</p>
  <p>The [=setup page=] UI allows the user to enter: (1) a [=wallet address=]; (2) an initial spending budget;
    (3) an optional automatic monthly renewal flag.</p>

  <p>For every new wallet connection, the browser MUST generate a fresh key pair by
  running the [=generate an Ed25519 key pair=] algorithm, replacing any previously stored key pair, and MUST display
  the newly generated [=encoded public key JWK=] (representing the [=Ed25519 public key=]) so the user can copy or
  upload it to their wallet provider. This key generation and public key
  exposure happen before invoking the algorithm below; if no key pair exists at invocation time the algorithm fails.</p>

  <p>To <b><em>process the wallet setup</em></b>, given a string |walletAddress:DOMString|
    (the [=wallet address=] provided by the user),
    a number |budget:number| (the budget that the user wants to use for Web Monetization) and
    a boolean |renewMonthly: boolean| (an option to renew the budget every month):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the result of the [=get auth keys=] algorithm is null, return failure.</li>
    <li>Let |walletAddressDetails:WalletAddressDetails| be the result of the [=send a wallet address request=] algorithm on |walletAddress|.</li>
    <li>
      Let |interval:DOMString| be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Repeating_intervals">ISO 8601 repeating interval</a>
      if |renewMonthly| is `true`.
      <span class="note">
        The starting date for the repeating interval needs to be the users current date (ISO String).

      Let |pendingGrant:PendingGrant| ({{PendingGrant}}) be the result of the [=send an outgoing payment and quote grant request=] algorithm with |walletAddressDetails|, |budget| and |interval|.
      <p class="note">
        Since we ask for access to outgoing payments, the user will have to interact with the grant (approve or decline). Currently in Open Payments, only the grants that request access to outgoing payments are interactive.

      Let |continueAccessToken:DOMString| be |pendingGrant|'s {{PendingGrant/continue}}.{{Continue/access_token}}.{{AccessToken/value}} property.
    </li>
    <li>
      (TODO: Look into browsing/navigation context, instead of specifying "open in a new tab") Open the |pendingGrant|'s {{PendingGrant/interact}}.{{PendingInteract/redirect}} property ([=Redirect URI=]) in a new tab to redirect the user to their wallet's [=IdP=], where the user can accept or decline the grant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let |wait:number| be |pendingGrant|'s {{PendingGrant/continue}}.{{Continue/wait}} property.
      <div class="note">
        <p>We cannot use the {{PendingInteract/finish}} redirect method as browser's internal URLs can not be opened from an external source.
          In the Open Payments scenario, the [=AS=] will have to redirect the user to the internal browser page for Web Monetization to continue the flow.</p>
        <p>Since we cannot use Open Payments' redirect {{PendingInteract/finish}} method,
          we will have to check every |wait| seconds (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)">polling</a>)
          to retrieve information about the grant (whether user accepted or rejected the grant).</p>

  <h3>Disconnecting a wallet</h3>
  <p>The user can disconnect their previously connected [=wallet=] via the [=setup page=] using a UI control
    (e.g. a "Disconnect Wallet" button) that requires explicit user confirmation (such as a confirmation dialog).</p>

  <p>Disconnecting a wallet revokes the active grant (if any) and clears state from {{Storage}}.</p>

        <li>Let |continueAccessToken:DOMString| be |grant|'s {{Grant/continue}}.{{Continue/access_token}}.{{ContinueAccessToken/value}}.</li>
        <li>Run the [=send a cancel grant request=] algorithm with |continueUri| and |continueAccessToken|.</li>
        <li class="note">Failure to cancel (e.g. network error) SHOULD surface a non-blocking warning to the user;
          the browser MAY still proceed with local cleanup.</li>

    <li>Run the [=clear wallet data=] algorithm.</li>
    <li class="note">All grant data, authentication keys, and wallet details are removed.
      Reconnecting will generate a new key pair requiring re-registration of the public key.</li>
